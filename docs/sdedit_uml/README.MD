Quick Sequence Diagram Editor
=============================

This tool makes creating UML sequence diagrams a piece of cake.  It's easier than any WYSIWYG editor where you contantly have to keep moving message calls and lines all over the place, and god-forbid you ever want to re-draw something with drastic changes.  This tool lets me use a simple text syntax language and then render PNG/vectors for publication.

Running It
----------

Dunno what works for others, but this worked for me:

 /home/dariens/Downloads/jdk1.7.0_67/bin/java  -Djava.awt.headless=false -jar /home/dariens/Downloads/sdedit-4.01.jar
